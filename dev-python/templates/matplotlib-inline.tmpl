# Although in theory we could depend on matplotlib, upstream does not.
# This is because the sole purpose of the package is to be loaded by
# ipython (also not a dependency!) as a response to interactive use of
# the "%matplotlib" magic.
#
# In order to be seamless and straightforward, this backend is always
# installed and just requires users using matplotlib, to install
# matplotlib before importing and using it.
